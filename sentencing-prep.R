# 1900 total population counts are from the 1900 (or Twelfth)
  # Census of the United States, Volume 1, Section 4, Population of states and territories
  # by counties, at each census: 1790 to 1900. Page 13. United States Census Office (1901).

  # 1900 detail population counts are from Volume 1, Section 9,

    # * Population totals for 1900 in many cases do not equal the sum of the racial components. Some counts were updated
    # in 1910, but still do not sum correctly. 
    # Summary counts for the State of Florida in 1900 are not reported here
    # because they are far too inconsistent (relative to the county totals and to the total population count) to be reliable.*

# 1910 population counts are from the 1910 (or Thirteenth) 
  # Census of Population and Housing, Supplement for Florida,
  # Chapter 2, 'Table I. Population and characteristics for the state and for counties.' 
  # Government Priting Office (1913). Pages 590-599.
